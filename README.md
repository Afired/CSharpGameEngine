## Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Download pre-compiled GLFW 64-bit binaries for Windows on the official site [glfw.org](https://www.glfw.org/).
3. Unpack the archive and copy the glfw3.dll out of the lib-vs2022 folder.
4. Paste the dll file into the output folder of your project.

## UML-Planning
The UML is created by using the open-source [drawio project](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio). 
It is a configurable diagramming/whiteboarding visualization application. draw.io is owned and developed by JGraph Ltd, a UK based software company.
You can view the UML Diagram by going to [draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/) and selecting this [file](https://github.com/Afired/CSharpGameEngine/blob/uml-planning/CSharpGameEngine.drawio) in the uml-planning branch.
